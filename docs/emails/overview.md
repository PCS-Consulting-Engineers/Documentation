# Microsoft Hosted Exchange - An Overview

Microsoft Hosted Exchange means our emails are hosted on Microsoft's servers using a system called Exchange to sync and access them.
This means it doesn't matter what device you view the emails on, they will be the same - you are just viewing a copy of the Microsoft server.

## Accessing your emails

As normal you can use Outlook Desktop (if you have a licence, see Office 365), but also mobile or web apps that support Exchange

To login, ensure you use a client which supports exchange (like Outlook), then simply enter your account (\<name\>@pcsconsultingengineers.com) making sure you log in as a work account if asked.

## Storage

This plan includes 100GB of storage in your normal mailbox, plus 100GB in archiving. The archive can also increase in size indefinitely. See [archiving](https://pcs-consulting-engineers.github.io/Documentation/#/emails/archiving) for further details.
