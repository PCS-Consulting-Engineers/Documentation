# Mapping the Network Drive

To be able to use the server files, it is easiest to map the network drive.

To do this, first ensure you are either on site or connected to the VPN. To test this, try to access [192.168.1.106](https://192.168.1.106). If the page loads, please proceed. Otherwise, try connecting to the VPN.

1. In Windows, open file explorer
2. Click *This PC*
3. Click *Map Network Drive* in the top ribbon
4. Select S as the drive letter (or any other available letter)
5. Enter ``\\192.168.1.106\Projects`` in the folder box
6. Ensure *Connect using different credentials* is ticked, click Finish
7. Enter your credentials
